    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is a continuation of the guided labs in Module 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will deploy a trained model and perform a prediction against the model. You will then delete the endpoint and perform a batch transform on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the business scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a healthcare provider, and want to improve the detection of abnormalities in orthopedic patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with solving this problem by using machine learning (ML). You have access to a dataset that contains six biomechanical features and a target of *normal* or *abnormal*. You can use this dataset to train an ML model to predict if a patient will have an abnormality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This biomedical dataset was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopaedics (GARO) of the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de Réadaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. The data has been organized in two different, but related, classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of three categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normal* (100 patients)\n",
    "- *Disk Hernia* (60 patients)\n",
    "- *Spondylolisthesis* (150 patients)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second task, the categories *Disk Hernia* and *Spondylolisthesis* were merged into a single category that is labeled as *abnormal*. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of two categories: *Normal* (100 patients) or *Abnormal* (210 patients).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each patient is represented in the dataset by six biomechanical attributes that are derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pelvic incidence\n",
    "- Pelvic tilt\n",
    "- Lumbar lordosis angle\n",
    "- Sacral slope\n",
    "- Pelvic radius\n",
    "- Grade of spondylolisthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The following convention is used for the class labels: \n",
    "- DH (Disk Hernia)\n",
    "- Spondylolisthesis (SL)\n",
    "- Normal (NO) \n",
    "- Abnormal (AB)\n",
    "\n",
